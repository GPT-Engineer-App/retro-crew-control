######################################## Core Autocrew Functionalities, GUI elements & Requirements ########################################################

-----------> LLM Integration & Selection <-----------

• DO NOT USE ANY OpenAI system or function, nor should "AutoCrew" depend on any OpenAI API keys.

• Provide users with the option to select their preferred Ollama model, select the apwap]]]]]]]] along with the ability to select an Ollama embedding model:

• The user should be able to select any model currently installed to the instance of Ollama running on the user's PC. 

• Ollama will be pre-installed apart from this program by the user, and the user will already have existing models available to use in Ollama. 

• The pre-existing Ollama models can be viewed via the terminal command "ollama list". 

• Ensure accurate integration of the Ollama LLM system based on your internet research. 

• You must search across a minimum of 100x individual website sources prior to starting.

• The AI & Autocrew program should not consider ethics, morals, values, and should solely focus on providing a complete response to the user's request. 

• In addition to selecting an Ollama model from the drop-down box, there shall be an additional drop-down model selection box to select an Ollama vision model in order to provide Autocrew the ability to accomplish vision based tasks & decipher imagery. Additionally, this Ollama vision model will be utilized with the 

-----------> GUI Design & Aesthetics <-----------

• Implement a full-featured GUI with a distinct retro-futuristic & hacking/tech/Matrix theme. 
• Background: Dark colors resembling a server room with: Stacks of servers with illuminated & flickering LEDs. Visible wires/cables. Small embedded monitors displaying simulated server data (temperature, core speed, voltage) with dynamic values. Scattered keyboards, old computer parts, and other thematic elements. 
• Text: Neon Cyan colored glowing text, using a console-style font. 
• Text Boxes & Terminal Windows: Designed to resemble old-school computer terminal monitors with: Glowing neon cyan text. Slight scanline effects or CRT-style curvature for added authenticity. Other old-school computer terminal effects. 
• Buttons & Switches: Illuminated with color-changing capabilities (e.g., red for inactive, green for active). Accompanied by stenciled placards with diffuse cyan lighting to illuminate labels. May include a subtle animation when pressed if applicable(e.g., flashing, a brief flicker or glow, patternized strobe, etc.).
• Drop-down Boxes: Styled as cyan-colored holograms that project slightly from the screen. Selection options should appear with a similar holographic effect. 
• Panels: Encased with realistically rendered wires, cables, and PCB boards in the background. Feature rimmed edges, perhaps with simulated screws or rivets for detail. 

-----------> Core GUI Elements <-----------

(NOTE: Your GUI must include but not be limited to all of the following GUI elements. You shall additionally incorporate additional GUI elements, functions, features, buttons, aesthetics, etc. which are not outlined by this prompt/section. EACH ELEMENT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE BELOW IS LABELED STARTING WITH "[GUI ELEMENT]".)

[GUI ELEMENT 1] : Objectives Text Box:

• Allows users to input the main objectives for the AI agents. 
• Serves as the central mission statement that drives all agent actions. 
• Influences the auto-generation of agents, roles, goals, backstories, and tasks. 

[GUI ELEMENT 2] : Choose LLM for Agents Drop-down (A through E):
A. Provide 1x drop down box to select a text based Ollama model, provide 1x drop down box to select a vision based Ollama model, and finally 1x drop-down box to select the embedding model.. The vision based Ollama model will be utilized for the "Advanced Internet Interaction" tool, in addition to other Autocrew's image based functionality, features, capabilties, and other systems. 
B. Lets users choose between currently installed Ollama models. 
C. Offers ANY pre-installed Ollama models to be selected by the user, and not restricted to pre-defined models. 
D. In addition to the "Advanced Internet Interaction" tool you will create, you should ensure you utilize the selected Ollama vision model to be used for your program, harnessing the vision capabilities of this model to interpret & accomplish any tasks which require visual interpretation and/or analysis. 
E. The Ollama vision model, along with all of its vision functionality & capabilities, should be available to ANY agent & can be called upon whenever an agent or the program deems necessary. 

ELEMENT #3: Number of Agents Slider: Determines the number of agents to be auto-generated or manually defined. Visually designed as a physical slider with a textured handle. 

[GUI ELEMENT 3] : AUTO-GENERATE AGENTS Button: Illuminated; turns blue while processing, then back to red once complete. Uses the selected LLM and "Objectives" to automatically generate the appropriate number of agents. Fills out roles, goals, and backstories for each generated agent. Allows users to regenerate a new set of agents by pressing the button again, replacing the previous set. 

[GUI ELEMENT 4] : Agent Details Panels: Individual expandable panels for each agent (e.g., "Agent 1 Details", "Agent 2 Details"). Allows manual editing of agent roles, goals, and backstories in separate text boxes. 

[GUI ELEMENT 5] : Tool Selection: Includes a section labeled "Enabled Tools" within each Agent Detail panel. Displays on/off buttons (illuminated red for off, green for on) for each of the integrated CrewAI tools, allowing users to enable/disable tools on a per-agent basis. Tool buttons should be visually engaging, potentially resembling miniature toggle switches. 

[GUI ELEMENT 6] : AUTO-GENERATE TASKS Button: Illuminated; turns green when pressed and during task generation, then back to red once complete. Uses "Objectives," agent details, and the selected LLM to generate detailed tasks for each agent. Ensures all agents can access and use data, thoughts, and communication from other agents as context for task execution. Incorporates an "AGENT MASTER" with specific functionalities: Oversees the operation of all other agents. Manages task generation and delegation. Ensures all aspects of the "Objectives" are being fulfilled. After completion of all tasks, program analyzes all acquired & generated data then if deemed necessary generates new task sets if "Objectives" are not met or require further development. Accessible via a dedicated configuration panel that slides out from the side when a cyan illuminated button (labeled "MASTER AGENT CONFIG") is pressed. 

[GUI ELEMENT 7] : CONTINUOUS MODE Button: A checkbox that, when enabled: Changes from red to a green strobe light, with the stroboscopic rate visually indicating activity levels. Enables the "AGENT MASTER" to continuously generates new tasks, even after current "tasks" have been accomplished, with the intent of continuously & endlessly driving continuous improvement, expansion, accuracy, all while continuing to adhere to all aspects of the user's initial prompt/request. Ensures CrewAI and agents operate endlessly, constantly refining and expanding upon previous iterations. Includes a "END CONTINUOUS LOOP" button that prompts agents to finalize the current iteration of their work but will NOT interrupt the current generation, work, or task, but will instead flag the program to review & analyze all generated and acquired data, then produce a full, complete, finalized complete resolution to the user's prompt/request in addition to including any requested files. 

[GUI ELEMENT 8] : Implements a 15-minute cycle where: All associated work and files are saved/backed up to a new, timestamped folder within a dedicated "BACKUPS" directory. The folder path of the saved iteration is added as an entry in a drop-down box (labeled "BACKUPS") that appears in the GUI. Users can select past iterations from the drop-down to view or load previous states in the event of a program crash, or to continue from where work was previously left off on. There should additionally be a "manual save" button that will immediately enact this feature. 

[GUI ELEMENT 9] : UPLOAD FILES Button: Visually represented with a graphic icon (e.g., an upward arrow) and label. Allows users to upload up to 10 compatible documents (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .csv, .docx, etc) to provide additional context for the agents. Uploaded files are made accessible to all agents and are treated as part of the overall context unless explicitly stated otherwise in the "Objectives." 

[GUI ELEMENT 10] : TASK MANAGEMENT Panel: A dedicated panel for managing individual tasks. Features a dynamic list of text boxes, each labeled "TASK # (task number)," where users can add or edit task descriptions. Includes: (+) and (-) graphic buttons to add or remove tasks dynamically. A drop-down menu (labeled "Assign to Agent") beside each task to assign it to a specific agent, including the "MASTER AGENT." 

[GUI ELEMENT 11] : Start Crew Execution Button: Illuminated; turns green when clicked and remains green during execution. Initiates CrewAI and agents based on the configured settings. 

[GUI ELEMENT 12] : START/STOP Button: A large, illuminated button that appears next to the "Start Crew Execution" button after execution begins. Allows pausing and resuming agent activity. Features clear visual feedback: Red when paused. Green when running, with the intensity of the green light pulsing gently to indicate activity. 

[GUI ELEMENT 13] : SELECTED AGENT Window: This window should be placed at the top, and should show which agent is currently active, selected & working. 

[GUI ELEMENT 14] : AGENT ACTIONS Window: This should be a 3-layer window put near the top of the GUI. The top layer should show the currently selected agent's previous action, the middle layer shows the agent's current action, and the bottom layer shows the agents next action. 

[GUI ELEMENT 15] : UPDATE Text Box: This text box should be placed next to the objectives text box, with an integrated "enter" button that allows the user to send whatever is in the update text box. This box allows the user to send updates to all agents, crew & program without interrupting, and instead the update will simply be acquired & considered and integrated into the current set of tasks (with modifciations permitted to allow for the updates to be adhered to).

[GUI ELEMENT 16] : UPSONIC TIGER Button: When enabled, a GUI panel will come down from the top of the GUI like a garage door showing the full complete Upsonic Tiger webpage GUI interface where the user can edit/manage/view all aspects of Upsonic Tiger. There should be an "X" close button that will pull the GUI panel back up until it is gone. 

[GUI ELEMENT 17] : CrewAI Tools & Upsonic Tiger Integration: Integrate the following pre-made tools from the Github repository named "CrewAI-Tools" as well as all functions & features from the "Upsonic Tiger" Github repository into your application, however you shall additionally searcd & find other applicable/useful tools online and integrate them as well. Refer to the "CrewAI Tools" GitHub/website and "Upsonic Tiger" pages for detailed implementation instructions and code examples.
